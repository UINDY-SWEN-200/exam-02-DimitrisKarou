See [FinalExam.pdf](FinalExam.pdf)

Edit the files in this repository to complete these three questions. For question 2 and 3 you can simply include you answers in this README.md file. For question 1, actually perform the merge. Leave the resulting code on checked in on the main branch.

1. GitHub/Testing

You should find two branches here:

- substring name search
- description search

Merge these two branches and edit/add tests to confirm both features still work.

2. Ethics Case Study: Read the case study

3. Design Alternatives: Read the design options and write a paragraph or two on making a case for a specific option, or outlining steps that could be taken to choose one option over the other.
